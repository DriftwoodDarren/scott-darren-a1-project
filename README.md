First assignment for Game Development Foundations - GAME 10003-02

Welcome to 'The Bheur Town!' 

This game takes place in a small village called Watersreach which lies in the Northern region of the continent. The story begins with Watersreach (and our hero) beset by an aggresive group of monsters. The hero will have to find out the correct path to victory against them. 

The game is not particularily long and it is a test of C# interaction, however there may be a more in depth version down the line. 

INSTRUCTIONS:
You will be prompted to make a decision based off the text. Each possible decision will have a number attached to it. Whenever you are told to enter a decision you will enter the number desired and hit enter. Be aware to not add any unnessecary spaces. The decision menu works on intergers and will not except string/characters or floats. Also be warned that entering a number other than what is listed may have unforseen results...
